5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

Linear because the collection is unsorted and binary does not work with unsorted

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

Binary because instead of iterating through each and every item, it would be able to eliminate large chunks of the collection and drastically cut down on time and CPU usage.

PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT

1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

function findWord(array, string) {
  let high = array.length - 1;
  let low = 0;

  while ( low <= high ) {
    let mid = Math.floor( (high + low) / 2 );
    if ( array[mid] == string ) {
      return mid;
    } else if ( array[mid] < string ) {
      let low = mid + 1;
    } else {
      let high = mid - 1;
    }
  }
  return null;
}

2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

function findFish(array, target) {
  for ( let i = 0 ; i < array.length ; i++ ) {
    if ( array[i] === target ) {
      return i;
    }
  }
  return null;
}
